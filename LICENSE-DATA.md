## Upstream sources and their terms

| Source | Terms | Used as |
|---|---|---|
| SEAP / e-licitatie.ro `api-pub` | Public data, Open Government Licence v1.0 | **Input** |
| data.gov.ro (ADR / ANAP quarterly exports) | Open Government Licence v1.0 | **Input** |
| ONRC / Ministerul Finanțelor | Public registry data | Input (enrichment, planned) |

## Sources deliberately NOT used as input

**OpenTender (opentender.eu/ro)**, published by the Government Transparency
Institute, is licensed **CC BY-NC-SA 4.0**. The NonCommercial and ShareAlike terms
are incompatible with publishing our own output under CC BY 4.0 — ingesting it
would make our dataset non-commercial and viral.

OpenTender is therefore used **only as an external validation reference** (comparing
our aggregates against theirs to detect systematic error). No OpenTender data enters
this pipeline. See `docs/sources.md`.

## Personal data

Upstream API responses contain personal data (names, e-mail addresses and phone
numbers of contract contact persons). These fields are stripped at the staging
boundary and never reach published artefacts. See `src/achizitii/gdpr.py` and
`METHODOLOGY.md`.
