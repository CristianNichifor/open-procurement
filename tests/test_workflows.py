"""A workflow that runs the tests must first fetch what the tests read.

The bundle moved out of git and into a release asset, and several tests read it directly —
`test_price_drilldown` opens `site/data/manifest.json` unconditionally, which is deliberate:
it used to carry a `skipif` that quietly became a pass. So every workflow that runs pytest has
to fetch the bundle first, and three did while two did not.

It was not caught by review, three times running. The first pass wired `pages.yml` and
`tests.yml` and missed `browser.yml`; fixing that one missed `daily.yml`, which failed on its
first scheduled run afterwards; and `bulk.yml` is dispatch-only, so it had not run since and
was still waiting to fail for whoever reached for it next. Each time the omission was invisible
in the diff, because the evidence is in a file the change does not touch.

So it is a test rather than a habit. Reading the workflow directory is the only way to ask the
question that was actually being got wrong: *is there a workflow that runs pytest and does not
fetch the bundle first* — including one added next year by someone who never read this.
